LookingLocal are very pleased to announce that BetterOff, our revolutionary platform developed with Kirklees Council, has been nominated for another award.

Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council went live with the platform in July and has now been nominated for an iNetwork award in the category of Innovative Access to Public Services.

Stockport has transformed its reception to provide a modern digital space where people are helped to access council services. BetterOff is a large part of this transformation; claimants are guided to the platform to access information about benefits and finding work. BetterOff offers a job-seeking journal in line with the Claimant Commitment and supports people via a number of digital means including web chat, real-time collaboration (think Google Docs meets benefit forms), video and audio guidance.
 
Stockport’s bold transformation of the way customers interact with the council has saved money and improved services in the short term, but importantly has created a framework and approach for future benefits and efficiencies
 
iNetwork is an organisation that helps to support local public service organisations to deliver more innovative, high quality and cost effective services, with the understanding that countless services and organisations within the sector are being asked to deliver more for less.
 
The Innovative Access to Public Services (IAPS) Award is inspired by iNetwork’s own IAPS programme, which enables local public services to be accessed in the most effective and joined up way. The award will be given to an organisation that can demonstrate innovation and achievement in providing access to frontline services to the public.
 
Voting for the awards is now open you can vote for your winners [here](http://annualconference.i-network.org.uk/vote/) and see more details on the Stockport nomination [here](http://annualconference.i-network.org.uk/stockport-digital-advice/). The public vote will close on the 6th October.
 
The awards winners will be announced at the iNetwork annual conference on the 16th November 2016.
