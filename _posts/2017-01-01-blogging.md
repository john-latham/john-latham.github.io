I've never blogged before, professionally or personally. This is mostly because I've been waiting to have an original thought.

I am sometimes asked to write things in long-form documents. They are painful to write and probably painful to read.

So I've decided to try blogging instead.

If you ask me to write something that need not contain personally sensitive information, I may ask you whether I can blog it instead.

Someone else may find it useful; regardless, the content will be improved by a desire to avoid embarrassing myself in public.
