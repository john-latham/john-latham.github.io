Delegates were there to hear about the potential co-funding opportunity of the new online platform, Everybody Active, currently being developed by Kirklees Council and LookingLocal. The purpose of the platform is to help increase physical activity in the local area. The aim of the day was for Kirklees Council to share their progress on the development of the platform so far and offer other organisations the opportunity to collaborate on the platform’s future progression.
 
Quick headlines of the day
- Overall aim is to find other organisations that would be willing to collaborate in co-funding the future development of Everybody Active;

- The platform is underpinned by CBT-based principles that encourage long-term behaviour change;
- The “Circle of Support” included in Everybody Active allows users to make social connections with friends, family and other users;
- Analysis found that the current face-to-face process to encourage people to become more active could be translated into a digital process;
- Everybody Active is designed to work alongside activity referral programmes;
- Everybody Active is being developed in an Agile way, with user engagement and feedback cycles integrated into the development process;
- Once live, people will be directed to the platform via ‘Activity Champions’ and volunteers;
- A key theme of the platform is “Early Intervention”
- Internal awareness training and ‘skilling-up’ of Activity Officers, will be key in encouraging people to use the platform;

The Show and Tell day was a chance for local authorities and health organisations to talk to those at Kirklees Council that are involved in the current development of the Everybody Active platform. There were lots of questions about other features that could be included in the platform, which is exactly what we were looking for. Ultimately, the aim is to find other organisations that would be willing to collaborate in co-funding and shaping the future development of Everybody Active and improving its current set of features and functionality.
 
The talks for the day were led by Alison Morby (Kirklees Council Sport and Physical Activity Development Manager), Juliet Jackson (Kirklees Council Sport and Physical Activity Operations Manager), Saul Muldoon (Kirklees Council Sport and Physical Activity Development Officer) and Helen Rhodes (Kirklees Council Communications and Marketing Manager). Talks were also given from Guy Giles (Managing Director) and Sheena Guthrie (Digital Health Analyst) from LookingLocal.  
 
# Developing Everybody Active
The presentations began by setting the scene of physical activity in Kirklees where 35% of people are inactive. The Kirklees Physical Activity Team realised that they needed to do more to reach a larger audience with their Everybody Active campaign. Work done through referral programmes such as the Practice Activity and Leisure Scheme (PALS) as well as input and feedback from other organisations gave insight into understanding what the next steps were for developing the current physical activity strategy and expanding the Everybody Active campaign.
 
# CBT model
After the “why”, the presentation lead into the “what” and “how” of the Everybody Active platform, explaining the different elements of the platform, in particular how the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) model, which underpins the platform, actually works.
 
Everybody Active is based on a CBT model which aims to motivate people to change their current levels of physical activity for the long-term. The system works to:
 
- Assess a person’s current level of activity
- Assess their confidence
- Suggest targets
- Make recommendations based on those targets
- Monitors progress and personalises the experience
 
One of the particularly important features included in Everybody Active is the “Circle of Support”, which allows users to make social connections with family or friends or other users of the platform. This is key for behaviour change, as research suggests people are more likely to make long-term behaviour changes when they have support from friends and family.

# Expanding Reach
After the run-through of the platform, discussion led onto the considerations that are being taken during the development of Everybody Active.
 
As mentioned above the aim for Kirklees Council was to be able to reach more people with their Everybody Active campaign. Analysis found that taking the face-to-face process that was currently in place to encourage people to become more active could be translated into a digital process and would, therefore, allow Kirklees to reach more people. Everybody Active is designed to work alongside activity referral programmes and will involve links with Activity Officers, Health Trainers, Primary Care Nurses and GP’s to refer people to the self-serve platform where appropriate, reducing pressure on heavily subscribed medical referral programmes.
 
Everybody Active is being developed in an Agile way, with user engagement and feedback integrated into the development. Early user feedback has informed the look and feel that will be implemented over the coming months as well as confirming the tone and language of the platform as friendly and encouraging.

# Practical Use
Presentations then moved onto the practical use of Everybody Active once it’s live in Kirklees.
 
The physical activity team at Kirklees plan to direct users to the platform via referral schemes via Activity Champions and volunteers which would ensure the platform is used. The overall aim for physical activity officers is “Early Intervention”, to be able to increase levels of activity and prevent long-term conditions. This also fits in with Kirklees Council’s “new council” vision where the people of Kirklees are empowered to do more for themselves and each other.
 
# Promoting the platform
A question often asked by delegates is “How do you ensure the platform is used?” Therefore, included in the presentation was a discussion surrounding the communications methods used for promoting the platform to end-users. Several key marketing channels were highlighted including resident magazines and social media. Alongside these methods was also the importance of internal awareness training and skilling up of Activity Officers, which will be instrumental in encouraging people to use the platform.

# How to be involved
To round-up the day, there was a discussion around the opportunity for organisations to implement Everybody Active locally in their area, as well as collaborate on the platform’s future development. The cooperative approach of several organisations coming together to co-fund and co-design the future development of Everybody Active will mean that the features and functionality that the platform provides could be enhanced to meet the needs of many.
 
Overall the day provided a great opportunity for local authorities and health organisation to come together and discuss this new online platform that could really make a difference to many people’s lives. The plan going forward will be to bring organisations together to discuss future plans in terms of expanding and evolving the product.
