**Last Thursday, LookingLocal hosted another successful Show and Tell event, bringing delegates from local authorities across the country together to showcase ScanStation, the integrated and transformative solution that delivers self-serve customer scanning for all kinds of documents and supporting evidence.**

The day consisted of presentations, discussions, and a hands-on demonstration to fully understand how ScanStation could benefit local authorities. 
 
The day was hosted by Steve Langrick, Head of Online, Channel Strategy & Development and Diane Chapman, Customer Service Centres Manager, both from Kirklees Council, LookingLocal’s New Business Manager Andrew Jackson, and Paul Meyers, our Business Analyst. These presenters highlighted the practical and business benefits of ScanStation, and answered questions about the opportunities it presents for the attending delegates. The highly interactive session gave delegates opportunities to delve into the details of the product, and look at how they might be able to use it to their specific advantages.
 
### The Digital Initiative

Steve kicked off the session. After joking about Huddersfield’s football success compared to its Yorkshire neighbours, he outlined Kirklees’ overall strategy for digitising and pushing their services online. He made it clear that Kirklees’ aim is to create a better experience for customers, with fewer queues and with customers self-serving quickly and easily. He made it clear that ScanStation is a key part of this wider initiative. 
 
Delegates did challenge him on a critically important point: whether the strategy of putting processes online would result in people who lack basic online skills and accessibility ‘falling through the net’, unable to access basic services, but the answer from Steve, and other delegates with similar approaches, was a resounding no, definitely not! Research carried out by Diane concluded that the majority of people are capable of quickly adapting to this service, with over 80% confidently using ScanStation after their first use, and only 5% of people requiring additional assistance. This was supported by delegates around the room, who emphasized how adaptive most people are to changes. Ultimately, it’s clear that people find a way to complete their forms and applications, regardless of their age or other factors.
 
### Adopting ScanStation: The Business Case

Diane gave a convincing demonstration of the business case for installing ScanStation, using the success of Kirklees’ implementation as an example. She spoke about how footfall and queueing has been significantly reduced; previously Kirklees Customer Contact Centre saw an upwards of 600 people per day, near on 100% of customers have now been channel shifted to the new self-serve approach . Diane went on to tell delegates about how Kirklees concluded that ScanStation was the right product for them, and answered a host of questions surrounding the practical aspects of implementing the product. For example, delegates were keen to know how much IT support was needed to maintain ScanStation. She answered with ease: LookingLocal offers ongoing support to customers, but when it comes to ScanStation, there is very little need for any support, the product largely runs itself because of its simplicity and intuitive user experience.
 
The ultimate takeaway from Diane’s talk was that ScanStation is “offering real benefits”, and delegates joked about how the “LookingLocal team are looking pretty smug after Diane’s presentation” … thanks Diane!
 
### ScanStation: The User Experience
 
Delivering a practical presentation between them, Andrew, our New Business Manager, and Paul, our Analyst, took delegates through the analysis stage and the ins-and-outs of the ScanStation application. Paul made it clear how important it is that local authorities fully understand what they stand to gain based on each of their own unique situations. Exploring footfall, customer behaviour, and current systems as part of the analysis stage is critical in ensuring that ScanStation is implemented based on the needs of an organisation. 
 
Andrew took delegates through the app, showcasing its intuitive user experience, moving them through the whole process from start to finish of scanning documents. Andrew faced some challenges from the delegates. They asked about how many pictures can be uploaded, how much bandwidth this might occupy, and whether uploading many images could crash the whole system if the files are too large. Practical questions from a practical audience. Ultimately, the answers to these questions lie with the councils themselves – if they have the bandwidth, then ScanStation will never face problems uploading large files with many images. 
 
### The Demonstration

The day concluded with a tour of Kirklees’ customer contact centre, with a hands-on demonstration delivered by staff in the council building. As well as the demonstration, delegates had an opportunity to see for themselves the constant flow of customers using ScanStation quickly and naturally. Seeing these customers using the self-scanners was the perfect illustration  – it’s clear that the public are using this technology naturally, and the assumption that certain people might not use it was demonstrably incorrect. Delegates also had an opportunity to discuss at length with the frontline staff, who lauded ScanStation as the technology that allowed them to work with those vulnerable customers who really need their support.
