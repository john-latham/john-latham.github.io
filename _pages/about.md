These blogs are made from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can find the code and content in the following Github repository:

[https://github.com/lookinglocal/lookinglocal.github.io](https://github.com/lookinglocal/lookinglocal.github.io)

...which was itself forked from the open-source [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

The content can be edited directly on Github; we are also experimenting with [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) for content management.

You are welcome to re-use (and modify) the modified templates and configuration in your own site, but please do not re-use content without permission.
